 * Motion follows eduarddragu.dev: strong ease-outs, nothing that bounces. Interface changes take 200
 * to 420 ms; things arriving take longer (520 ms, 720 ms for a page's main card, about a second for
 * the name on Home) and move short distances (8, 16 or 24dp). Staggers are 70 ms. The same tokens
 * live on the site as CSS variables, and in the habit tracker, where this file comes from.
